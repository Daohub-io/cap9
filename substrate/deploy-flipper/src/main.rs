//! This example shows how to use the predefined contract extrinsics found in the extrinsic module.
//! General (slightly outdated) background on how to deploy ink! contract is found here:
//! `https://substrate.dev/docs/en/contracts/deploying-a-contract`
//!
//!
//! *Note*: The runtime module here is not in the generic substrate node. Hence, this example
//! must run against the customized node found in `https://github.com/scs/substrate-test-nodes`.
